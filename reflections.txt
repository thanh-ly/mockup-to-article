Your response goes here!

1. what new skills have I learned?
I've learned about sublime and started using it instead of typing all of my tags, every time. 

2. what has been easy/difficult? 
The tutorials have been easy and the quizzes are straightforward, but trying to pay attention instead of spacing out is a challenge. 

3. How have you used the problem solving strategies... etc
I looked up some best practices between the use of a <p> tag vs. a <br> tag, and why one should use one over the other.
